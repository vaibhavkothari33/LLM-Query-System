**Design an LLM-Powered Intelligent Query‚ÄìRetrieval System** that can process large documents and make contextual decisions. Your system should handle real-world scenarios in insurance, legal, HR, and compliance domains.
**Input Requirements:**
* Process PDFs, DOCX, and email documents
* Handle policy/contract data efficiently
* Parse natural language queries
**Technical Specifications:**
* Use embeddings (FAISS/Pinecone) for semantic search
* Implement clause retrieval and matching
* Provide explainable decision rationale
* Output structured JSON responses
**Sample Query:**
*"Does this policy cover knee surgery, and what are the conditions?"*

**EVALUATION PARAMETERS**
**3.1)** Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
**a**
**Accuracy**
Precision of query understanding and clause matching
**b**
**Token Efficiency**
Optimized LLM token usage and cost-effectiveness
**c**
**Latency**
Response speed and real-time performance
**d**
**Reusability**
Code modularity and extensibility
**e**
**Explainability**
Clear decision reasoning and clause traceability

**Scoring System Explanation**
1. **Document Types**
   * *Known Documents*: Publicly available
   * *Unknown Documents*: Private & unseen
2. **Document-Level Weightage**
   * *Known Documents*: Low weightage (e.g., 0.5)
   * *Unknown Documents*: High weightage (e.g., 2.0)
3. **Question-Level Weightage**
   * Each question may have its own weight (e.g., some are worth more due to complexity or importance).
4. **Score Calculation**
   * For each correct answer: Score = Question Weight √ó Document Weight
   * Final score is the **sum of all such scores** across all documents.
**üìä Example**
**Documents:**
* *Doc A (Known)* ‚Äì Weight: 0.5
* *Doc B (Unknown)* ‚Äì Weight: 2.0
**Questions:**

**üßÆ Total Score:**
* *Doc A Contribution*: 0.5
* *Doc B Contribution*: 2.0 + 4.0 = 6.0
* **Final Score = 0.5 + 6.0 = 6.5**
**‚úÖ Key Points**
* Correct answers from **unknown documents** contribute more.
* **High-weight questions** boost your score significantly.
* **Incorrect or unattempted questions** contribute 0, regardless of weight.
